# Spicy Lyrics

Hi, I'm Spikerko (the person who made this repo). I've been really passionate about this project, and I'm really happy for this project.

I've seen a problem with the Spotify Lyrics. They're plain, just static colors. So I wanted to build my own version. I started building it recently. And also trying to focus on what the user wants. And here we are, me building a lyrics extension called **Spicy Lyrics**. Hope you like it!
